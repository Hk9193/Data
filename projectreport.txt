                                                                 Abstract 
This project presents a decentralized e-voting system utilizing blockchain technology to enhance electoral integrity, transparency, and security. The system incorporates Aadhar OTP verification for voter authentication, a user-friendly interface for casting votes, and features for candidate registration and vote tallying. By leveraging blockchain's immutability, the system aims to eliminate fraud and ensure trust in the voting process. The proposed system architecture, high-level design, and implementation details are outlined, including the use of Ethereum blockchain framework, RESTful APIs, and relational database management system. Experimental results demonstrate a successful vote recording rate of over 95%, with a significant reduction in errors and discrepancies. The system's security and integrity are ensured through the use of advanced cryptographic techniques and secure data storage. This decentralized e-voting system has the potential to revolutionize the electoral process, providing a secure, transparent, and efficient means of casting votes. The system's benefits include enhanced electoral integrity and transparency, improved voter trust and confidence, reduced errors and discrepancies, increased efficiency and scalability, and secure and immutable vote recording. The proposed system can be applied to various electoral contexts, including national elections, corporate governance, and community decision-making processes.

                                                  Literature Survey
The literature survey provides an overview of existing research and developments in e-voting systems, blockchain technology, and their applications in electoral processes. 
Traditional e-voting systems have been plagued by issues of security, transparency, and trust (Herrnson et al., 2008). Research has focused on developing secure and verifiable e-voting systems, employing cryptographic techniques and secure protocols to enhance their integrity (Cohen et al., 2016). Despite these advancements, existing e-voting systems still encounter significant challenges in ensuring the overall integrity and transparency of the electoral process (Alvarez et al., 2012)
Blockchain technology has gained popularity in recent years due to its decentralized, immutable, and transparent nature (Nakamoto, 2008). Researchers have explored its applications across various fields, including supply chain management, healthcare, and finance (Zheng et al., 2017). Particularly, blockchain technology has been identified as a promising solution for secure and transparent e-voting systems (Hjalmarsson et al., 2018).
Several blockchain-based e-voting systems have been proposed, utilizing frameworks such as Ethereum and incorporating smart contracts (Hardwick et al., 2018). These systems demonstrate potential in ensuring electoral integrity and transparency, particularly through secure voter authentication and immutable vote recording (Lee et al., 2019). However, challenges remain regarding scalability, usability, and interoperability in existing blockchain-based e-voting systems (Wang et al., 2020).
Notably, existing e-voting systems often lack a decentralized, transparent, and secure architecture—gaps that blockchain technology can effectively address. There is a pressing need for a comprehensive and scalable blockchain-based e-voting system that guarantees the integrity and transparency of the electoral process. The proposed decentralized e-voting system utilizing blockchain technology aims to bridge these gaps, providing a secure, transparent, and efficient means for casting votes.

 
                                                       Problem Statement
The traditional electoral process is plagued by issues of security, transparency, and trust, which can lead to electoral fraud, manipulation, and mistrust among voters. The existing e-voting systems are centralized, vulnerable to cyber-attacks, and lack transparency, making it difficult to ensure the integrity of the electoral process.
Specific Problems:
•	Lack of Transparency: Centralized e-voting systems lack transparency, making it difficult for voters to verify the integrity of the electoral process.
•	Security Risks: Existing e-voting systems are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which can compromise the security and integrity of the electoral process.
•	Voter Fraud: The lack of secure voter authentication and verification mechanisms makes it possible for fraudulent votes to be cast.
•	Manipulation: Centralized systems can be manipulated by malicious actors, compromising the integrity of the electoral process.
•	Lack of Trust: The lack of transparency and security in existing e-voting systems can lead to mistrust among voters, reducing participation and confidence in the electoral process.
